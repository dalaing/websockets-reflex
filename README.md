Note: development is happening over [here](https://github.com/dalaing/reflex-server-websocket) now.

These are `reflex` bindings for `websockets`, with the aim of matching the websocket API from `reflex-dom`.
They should work for servers and for clients.

There is also some code to help use this from within `snap`.
